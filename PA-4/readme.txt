NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

: Discussion with peers.
=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

: I will use a dynamically allocated 2D integer array to remember which 
cells have already been added to the queue.

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

: You mark a cell as visited after you evaluate the cell and see that it 
is not 'F', and also only if it is a period, and has not been visited yet.

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

: My "mymaze.txt" file consists of two paths: one that snakes around the 
entire grid to the end, and one that shortcuts and only makes one U-turn 
to get to the finish. When I ran my program on it, it behaved as expected.

============================== Remarks ==================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

: About 7-8 hours total.

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially 
useful to know if you turned it in incomplete.

: No, not anything too big.

Do you have any other remarks?

: This was a cool/fun PA! I liked programming this one much more than I 
did some of the other PA's. Thank you!
