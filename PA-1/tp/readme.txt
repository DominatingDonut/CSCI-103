1. Why run more simulations and wait longer if an accurate result can be 
found with fewer simulations?

We run many simulations to ensure that our result is an accurate 
representation of the true mean. Although it is possible that we get an 
accurate result with only a few runs of the simulation, it is not likely that 
we will continue to get very accurate results if we continue to run few 
simulations. The more simulations we run, the smaller variance we get, thus 
ensuring more accuracy in our result. Therefore, we run many simulations to 
have consistent accuracy in our results, even if it may take longer.

2. Use your table to suggest the point of diminishing returns (indicate a 
number of simulations to perform) where performing more games simulations 
does not improve the accuracy significantly.

I think the point of diminishing returns would be at 100,000 simulations.
At 100,000 simulations, the results vary by about 0.02 on average, which is 
significantly smaller variance than when one runs 10,000 simulations.

Summary:

In order to ensure that the most amount of toilet paper remains when the 
first roll becomes empty, we should all be small-roll choosers.
