: None.

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Which kind of a loop did you use for the first program? Why?

: I used a while loop in my first program because I wanted the program to
continuously loop until the number reached 1; I felt that using a while 
loop, instead of a for loop, and setting the condition of that while loop 
to (number != 1) was the easiest way for me to execute that.

2a. Once you've completed the second program, run hailstats on the following
inputs, and record your results in the table below:

  input range  | minimum length | achieved by | maximum length | achieved by
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    50 100     |        6       |      64     |       118      |     97      
   100 200     |        7       |     128     |       124      |    171      
   200 400     |        8       |     256     |       143      |    327      

2b. What pattern do you think there is in the values achieving minimum length?
Can you explain why it holds?

: The values that achieve the minimum length are powers of 2; if the beginning 
number is a power of 2, it simply has to keep dividing by 2 to reach 1, thus 
resulting in the least amount of steps possible. However, if the number is not 
a power of 2, at some point, it will have to multiply by 3 and add 1, thus 
adding more steps and resulting in a much larger length.

3a. Let X be the smallest integer whose length is greater than 150.
By running your hailstats program several times on carefully chosen inputs,
determine what is the value of X.

X is : 703

3b. Explain, briefly, the way in which you used your hailstats program
(i.e., which inputs you gave it) to find this answer.

: First, I checked the range between 1 and 500, and noticed that the max 
achieved between 1 and 500 was only 143, meaning that X has to be greater than 
500. Then I input the range 501 to 1000, and observed that the maximum length 
was 178, achieved by 871. The next range I checked was 501 to 870, excluding 
the previous max, and found that the maximum was 170, achieved by 703. To 
check if there were any numbers smaller than 703 that had a length greater 
than 150, I input the range 501 to 702, and the max length was 144, thus 
proving that 703 was the smallest integer with a length greater than 150.

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

: Programming hailstone and hailstats took me about 6 hours total, and filling 
out this readme.txt took me about an hour.

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: None

Do you have any other remarks?

: This was a fun and very challenging assignment, and I enjoyed doing solving 
it!
